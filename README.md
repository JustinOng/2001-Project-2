## CE2001 - Algorithms Project 2
This repository contains our solution and utility scripts for Lab Project 2 of `CE2001 Algorithms`. This project requires us to find the distance and path to the top `k` nearest hospitals in an undirected unweighted graph with `h` hospitals.

We implemented Multi Source Breadth-First search to find the top-`k` nearest hospitals given two input files containing a list of edges and a list of hospitals.

- `2001.jar`:
  - Exported `.jar` of the search algorithm
  - `java -jar 2001.jar edges.txt hospitals.txt k [--out outfile.txt] [--include-path]`
    - `edges.txt`: input file containing edges in the format
      ```
      0 1
      1 0
      1 2
      2 1
      ```
    - `hospitals.txt`: input file containing hospitals in the format
      ```
      # 1
      1
      ```
    - `k`: number of nearest hospitals to compute paths to
    - `--out outfile.txt`: name of file to write output data to. defaults to writing just distance to hospitals
    - `--include-paths`: specify this to write full path data to `outfile.txt`
  - output file example (`--include-path`):
    ```
    Vertex id=2 11(1) [2-11], 13(3) [2-59-16-13], 40(4) [2-11-20-56-40]
    ```
    Top 3 nearest hospitals to Vertex id=2:
    1. Distance 1 to `Vertex id=11`, through vertices `2-11`
    2. Distance 3 to `Vertex id=13`, through vertices `2-59-16-13`
    3. Distance 4 to `Vertex id=40`, through vertices `2-11-20-56-40`
  - output file example (without `--include-path`):
    ```
    Vertex id=2 11(1), 13(3), 40(4)
    ```
