## CE2001 - Algorithms Project 2 
Our Multi Source Breadth-First Search Algorithm begins by reading in graph data from a text file(file1), using the information contained within it to generate vertices and edges. 
Each vertex stores an id, an array list of neighbour vertices, an array of paths and number of paths to k hospitals. 
Lastly, we would read all the hospital nodes from another text file(file2) as given in the lab report 2.
